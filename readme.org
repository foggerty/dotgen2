* Introduction

A Janet rewrite of my project [[https://github.com/foggerty/dotgen][dotgen]], originally written in Ruby.

Argh..... Recursion breaks my brain sometimes (a lot)......

1. Simple program to take configuration, make sure that it's valid.  Not worrying about error messages yet, just fail if it's bad.  Spits out dot files.
2. Use argspare thingie from spork.
3. Detailed error reporting.
4. Cmd line options to preview output before writing etc.
5. Add in os-dependant options.
6. Break out the configuration definition into own file.  Then modify validation routines to follow definition when validating configuration.  Put into separate library.
7. Incorporate lib into main program.
8. Profit.
