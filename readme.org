* Introduction

A Janet rewrite of my project [[https://github.com/foggerty/dotgen][dotgen]], originally written in Ruby.

Argh..... Recursion breaks my brain sometimes......

1 - Simple program to take configuration, make sure that it's valid, don't worry about error messages yet, just fail if it's bad.  Spits out dot files.

2 - Detailed error reporting.

3 - Add in os-dependant options.

4 - Break out the configuration definition into own file.  Then modify validation routines to follow definition when validating configuration.  Put into separate library.
